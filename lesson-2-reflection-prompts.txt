What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  When you initialize a repository, git creates additional (hidden) files
  that track changes to the file(s) included in the repository. This tracking
  enables version control, more creative programming, and greater control
  over the programming environment.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The staging area is an intermediate location between the working directory
  and the repository. The staging area allows (and forces) you to think 
  about which files to include in a repository before actually adding 
  them. More careful reflection leads to better decisions.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history

the diagram the way we do?
